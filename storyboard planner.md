## Prologue — "The Debt" (IN GAME 🟩)

**When:** First launch / New Campaign  
**Voice:** Narrator (documentary tone — Ghanaian English)  
**Length target:** 60–90 seconds (~12 lines)  
**Data:** `src/conversations.json` → `prologue` · Save flag `prologueSeen` in `campaign.js`

### State of affairs (draft beats)

1. **WWII** — Gold Coast men served Britain. Promises made in the King's name.
2. **Demobilization** — Veterans return home. Benefits delayed, denied, buried in colonial ledgers.
3. **1947 Accra** — Ex-servicemen's Union grows. UGCC organizers meet in markets and churches.
4. **Boycott** — Nii Kwabena Bonne III's movement. Shops close. The colony feels the pressure.
5. **Nkrumah's line** — Peaceful petition, not rebellion. Ink before iron.
6. **The march planned** — 28 February 1948. Christiansborg Castle. Two thousand unarmed veterans.
7. **Hand to player** — *You are Sergeant Adjetey. Your squad owes the Crown nothing — the Crown owes you everything.*

### Prologue conversation draft

| # | Speaker | Line (draft) |
|---|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Narrator | They sent us to Burma, to Italy, to die for a King we never met. |
| 2 | Narrator | When we came home, the Treasury said the debt was settled. The ledgers said otherwise. |
| 3 | Narrator | In Accra, in '47, we stopped asking politely. |
| 4 | Narrator | Dr. Nkrumah spoke of self-government — not with rifles, but with signatures and witnesses. |
| 5 | Narrator | On the twenty-eighth of February, we would march to Christiansborg unarmed. |
| 6 | Narrator | A petition. A promise kept by the people, if not by the Governor. |
| 7 | Narrator | Sergeant Adjetey — you, Attipoe, Lamptey — you do not start a war today. |
| 8 | Narrator | You gather truth. You protect the march. You make sure the world is watching. |

*Edit freely — but do not change the date, the peaceful intent, or the martyrs' fate.*
